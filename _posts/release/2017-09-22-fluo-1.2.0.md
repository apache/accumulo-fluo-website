Apache Fluo follows [semver](http://semver.org/) for its API . The API consists
of everything under the `org.apache.fluo.api` package. Code outside of this
package can change at any time. If your project is using Fluo code that falls
outside of the API, then consider [initiating a discussion](/getinvolved/)
about adding it to the API.

## Significant changes

The major changes in 1.2.0 are highlighted here, for the complete list of changes, see the [1.2.0
Milestone] on Github.

### Fluo now supports multiple ways for running Fluo applications

Before 1.2.0, Fluo applications could only be run in YARN or as local processes. For 1.2.0, the Fluo tarball
was refactored to support other ways of running Fluo applications such as Docker, Kubernetes & Marathon. This
refactoring has the following notable changes:

* The Fluo tarball is now designed for only initializing Fluo and running local processes.
* The `fluo.properties` configuration file was deprecated and was replaced by `fluo-conn.properties` and `fluo-app.properties`.
  - `fluo-conn.properties` contains connection properties and is shared by Fluo applications
  - `fluo-app.properites` contains application-specific properties and is only used during initialization of Fluo applications.
* Code for launching Fluo applications in YARN was moved to its [own project][fluo-yarn] that has its own
  [release][fluo-yarn-release] tarball. The Fluo tarball can still be used to launch Fluo applications
  in YARN if a `fluo.properties` is created from `fluo.properties.deprecated`.
* Fluo application jars are now stored in HDFS and application configuration is now stored in Zookeeper.  This information used to be stored in a local directory.  This change made running Fluo different ways (like YARN or Docker) possible.

Read the [quickstart documentation][quickstart] to learn how to run Fluo applications using these new methods.
