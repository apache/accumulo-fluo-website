title: Apache Fluo 2.0.0
date: 2023-04-18 15:00:00 +0000
version: fluo-2.0.0
---

Apache Fluo is a distributed processing system that lets users make incremental
updates to large data sets.  With Apache Fluo, users can set up workflows that
execute cross node transactions when data changes. These workflows enable users
to continuously join new data into large existing data sets without
reprocessing all data.  Apache Fluo is built on [Apache Accumulo].

Apache Fluo follows [semver](http://semver.org/) for its API . The API consists
of everything under the `org.apache.fluo.api` package. Code outside of this
package can change at any time. If your project is using Fluo code that falls
outside of the API, then consider [initiating a discussion](/getinvolved/)
about adding it to the API.

## Notable changes

The major changes in 2.0.0 are highlighted here, for the complete list of changes, see the [2.0.0
Milestone] on Github.

 * Many performance and bug fixes were made.
 * Fluo was updated to work with Accumulo 2.1.0, Java 11, and Hadoop 3
 * Added scan authorizations to snapshots [1120]
 * Added asynchronous get methods to snapshots for reading data. [969]
 * Added asynchronous submit method to LoaderExecutor [1100] [1113]
 * Added option to Fluo's scan command to show notifications.  [1026]
 * Fluo now sets Accumulo scan hints. This can be used to optimize Fluo server side scan execution in Accumulo. [1072]
 * Summaries of Fluo's metadata are generated in Accumulo. This could be used to select files for compaction in Accumulo. [1071]
